Revision history for Perl extension warnings::DynamicScope.
$Id: Changes,v 1.7 2005/08/07 11:38:55 kay Exp $

1.02  
    - Defined new package variable named "$DYNAMIC_W_BITS".
      The tied hash "%^W" no longer accesses to the variable
      "${^WARNING_BITS}" unless it is accessed in BEGIN block.
    - Now the hash "%^W" accepts keyword "FATAL" as value.
      If the value is set to "FATAL", it returns 2 as value.
    - Added "DEAD BIT", "BEGIN BLOCK", and "$^W AND %W" section
      in POD document.
    - Improved handling of the variable "$^W". It's value is always
      synchronized with the value of "$^W{all}".
    - Made "%^W" realize "-W" and "-X" command line switches.

1.01  Thu Aug  4
