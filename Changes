1.03  Wed Aug 10 2005
    - Fixed a bug the value of $^W was not set properly in
      BEGIN block.

1.02  Sun Aug 07 2005
    - Defined new package variable named "$DYNAMIC_W_BITS".
      The tied hash "%^W" no longer accesses to the variable
      "${^WARNING_BITS}" unless it is accessed in BEGIN block.
    - Now the hash "%^W" accepts keyword "FATAL" as value.
      If the value is set to "FATAL", it returns 2 as value.
    - Added "DEAD BIT", "BEGIN BLOCK", and "$^W AND %W" section
      in POD document.
    - Improved handling of the variable "$^W". It's value is always
      synchronized with the value of "$^W{all}".
    - Made "%^W" realize "-W" and "-X" command line switches.

1.01  Thu Aug  04 2005
    - Modefied POD document.
    - Added a few tests.

1.00  Thu Aug  04 2005
